# Dotfiles
This repo contains the macOS setup that I like to make my machine feel cozy.

> **Note:** May *you*, the curious wanderer who ended up here, use it for inspiration. But be warned that it comes at your very own responsibility.

## Configure Ghostty (zsh)
Ghostty is configured with Fish as the default shell, using a custom Solarized Dark-inspired prompt.

1. Install Ghostty and syntax tools:
```bash
brew install ghostty zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions
```

2. Symlink the Ghostty config:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/ghostty
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/ghostty/config ~/.config/ghostty/config
```

> **IMP:** In `ghostty/config`, uncomment the section corresponding to `zsh`.

5. Remove the 'Last login ...' message:
```bash
touch ~/.hushlogin
```

## Configure Terminal (bash)
1. Clone this repo in `~/` in a new machine
2. Add `~/.bashrc` with the following contents:
```bash
[ -n "$PS1" ] && source ~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile;
```

3. Add `~/.bash_profile` with the contents:
```bash
source ~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile;
```

4. In `Terminal > Settings` in the default profile:
   - Adjust the font to `SF Mono Regular 14`
   - Adjust the background color to `black` with `90%` opacity and `50%` blur.
   - Adjust the font color for `Text` and `Bold text` to white, and selection to `#755337`.
   - Adjust the window to `80 columns` and `30 rows`.
   - Adjust the 'ANSI blue' color to `#FFB500` (orange).

## Configure VSCode
The settings file has to be symlinked so that VSCode uses the one in this repo:
- VSCode settings file: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`

```bash
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vscode/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/
```

Requirements:
- Railgun theme

## Configure vim
Link config to the one in this repo:
```
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

## Other configuration
1. In `~/` add a `.gitconfig` with the content:
```
[include]
  path = ~/.dotfiles/.my_gitconfig
```
5. Install the Git Autocompletion executable with:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash
```
6. Run `.config_macos.sh` to config macOS settings.
7. Other settings:
   - Trackpad speed: `8/10`

**IMP: Always push changes made locally to keep them in sync here!**
